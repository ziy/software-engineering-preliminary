\section{Creating Maven project from the archetype}

For this task, we have created an archetype for you to base on, which means you
don't need to manually input shared information, e.g., configurations for the
Maven repositories, compile plug-in, etc. The tutorial for Homework 0 might also
be helpful for you when you are creating a Maven project.

\begin{enumerate}

\item The first thing you should do is to inform m2e where to find the
archetypes. Open your Eclipse's \textbf{Preferences} window, and navigate to
\textbf{Maven} $\rightarrow$ \textbf{Archetypes}, and click \textbf{Add Remote
Catalog\ldots}. (See Figure \ref{fig:archetype-01-catalog})

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{archetype-01-catalog}
\caption{Configuring Maven catalog\label{fig:archetype-01-catalog}}
\end{figure}

\item Type the following URL into the \textbf{Catalog File} field.

\begin{verbatim}
http://ziy.github.com/hw1-archetype/repository/archetype-catalog.xml
\end{verbatim}

Optionally, you can add a \textbf{Description} for this catalog, for example
``Course Catalog''. See Figure \ref{fig:archetype-02-add}. Then click
\textbf{OK} on the \textbf{Remote Archetype Catalog} window and another
\textbf{OK} on the \textbf{Preferences} window.

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{archetype-02-add}
\caption{Adding a remote catalog\label{fig:archetype-02-add}}
\end{figure}

\item Now you can follow almost the same steps to create a Maven project hosted
on GitHub, you can refer to Homework 0 to find out how to create an empty
project on GitHub, and how the project can be imported to Eclipse. Since we have
created the archetype for you, remember to unselect \textbf{Create a simple
project (skip archetype selction)} (see Figure \ref{fig:archetype-03-new}). Then
click \textbf{Next}.
 
\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{archetype-03-new}
\caption{Unselecting ``Create a simple project''\label{fig:archetype-03-new}}
\end{figure}

\item Here you can select ``Course Catalog'' (or other names you specified in
the previous step) or ``All Catalogs'' in the drop-down menu for
\textbf{Catalog}. Then, type in ``hw1-archetype'' (without quotes) in the \textbf{Filter}
field. While you are typing, you will find the progress bar indicates you that
it is busy ``Retrieving archetypes''. Select the archetype listed below, and
click next to continue. See Figure \ref{fig:archetype-04-filter}. Note that
since we will continue improving the archetype or fixing bugs if any, the
version number cannot different from what you see in the figure.

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{archetype-04-filter}
\caption{Filtering the archetype you want to base on\label{fig:archetype-04-filter}}
\end{figure}

\item In the next window, you are asked to specify the \textbf{Group Id} and
\textbf{Artifact Id}. Similar to Homework 0, the Group Id is

\begin{center}
\textbf{edu.cmu.lti.11791.f12.hw1}
\end{center}

and Artifact Id is

\begin{center}
\textbf{hw1-ID}
\end{center}

with ID being your Andrew Id. Then click \textbf{Finish}. See Figure
\ref{fig:archetype-05-param}.

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{archetype-05-param}
\caption{Specifying artifact parameters\label{fig:archetype-05-param}}
\end{figure}

\item Now you have a new Maven project created from the archetype, which means
there will be no extra steps to manually edit the \verb|pom.xml| file on your
own. Instead the archetype includes most information Maven needs to execute
goals.

The only information that Maven doesn't know about from archetype or the
information we have typed to create the project is SCM. You need to edit the
\texttt{pom.xml} file to type in the SCM information of your GitHub repository
for Homework 1 as you did in Homework 0.

\end{enumerate}

You can see that we have included

\begin{itemize}

\item two java files in the \texttt{src/main/java} folder:
\texttt{PosTagNamedEntityRecognizer.java}, which includes the algorithm that
extracts name entities based on part-of-speech tags, and a
\texttt{SimpleRunCPE.java}, copied from uima-examples package, which you can use
as an entry point to test your CPE.

\item and two files in the \texttt{src/main/resources/data} folder,
\texttt{sample.in} and \texttt{sample.out}, which correspond to the sample input
file and the sample output file, and you can also use them to train your model
if you are trying to use a supervised approach.

\item the \texttt{pom.xml}. You can go to the \textbf{Dependencies} tab after
you double-click the pom file, and you will be able to see all the UIMA SDK
packages have been added to your Maven project by the archetype, and they will
be stored on your local Maven repository (e.g., \texttt{~/.m2/repositories}).
You will not need to follow the official instruction to uncompressed the SDK
package and specify the \verb|UIMA_HOME| as your environment parameter unless
you want to execute a UIMA program outside your project.

\end{itemize}

Your implementation starts here.

\begin{qa}

\item[Q1] Creating a new Maven project from archetype you provided failed due to
``Could not transfer artifact
edu.cmu.lti.11791.f12.hw1:hw1-archetype:pom:0.0.1''.

\item[A1] \emph{\textbf{UPDATE}: You are unlikely to see this error any more,
please update the Catalog URL to
\url{http://ziy.github.com/hw1-archetype/repository/archetype-catalog.xml})}.

There seems to be a problem with the m2e plug-in again. You can turn to the
command line directly to execute the Maven \texttt{archetype:generate} goal.
Specifically,

\begin{enumerate}

\item At the begining of creating a Maven project, DO check
\textbf{Create a simple project (skip archetype selction)} in the \textbf{New Maven Project}
window as you did in Homework 0. It will end up with a Eclipse project where the
connection to GitHub has been established, the Maven and Java natures have been
added to the Eclipse project configuration file.

\item Then, delete the \verb|pom.xml| file automatically generated from m2e.

\item Now you need to open a command line, \verb|cd| (``change directory'' command in
most command line shells) to your workspace directory (where you can use
\verb|ls| command to see your \verb|hw1-ID| directory, and execute the following
command (change the ID and PASSWORD with your Andrew ID and Maven password) to
the command line

\small
\begin{verbatim}
mvn archetype:generate \
-DinteractiveMode=true \
-DarchetypeArtifactId=hw1-archetype \
-DarchetypeCatalog=CATALOG_URL \
-DarchetypeGroupId=edu.cmu.lti.11791.f12.hw1 \
-DarchetypeRepository=REPO_URL \
-DarchetypeVersion=0.0.1
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

where the \verb|CATALOG_URL| and \verb|REPO_URL| should be replaced by
\verb|http://ID:PASSWORD@mu.lti.cs.cmu.edu:8081/nexus/content/|
\verb|groups/course/archetype-catalog.xml| and
\verb|http://ID:PASSWORD@mu.lti.cs.cmu.edu:8081/nexus/content/|
\verb|groups/course/| respectively. (Don't forget to replace ID and PASSWORD
with your Andrew ID and Maven password.)

It will execute an interactive process to generate the Maven project, and you
will need to type the same information we show you above, which will be similar
to this:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
Define value for property 'groupId': : 
  edu.cmu.lti.11791.f12.hw1
Define value for property 'artifactId': : 
  hw1-ziy
Define value for property 'version':  1.0-SNAPSHOT: : 
  0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
Define value for property 'package':  edu.cmu.lti.11791.f12.hw1: : 
  edu.cmu.lti.11791.f12.hw1.ziy
Confirm properties configuration:
groupId: edu.cmu.lti.11791.f12.hw1
artifactId: hw1-ziy
version: 0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
package: edu.cmu.lti.11791.f12.hw1.ziy
 Y: : 
   Y
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

\item When you see a ``BUILD SUCCESS'' at the end of the process, you can return
to Eclipse, refresh the project (click on the name of the project in the
``Package Explorer'' View, and press F5 or right-click and select
\textbf{Refresh}).

\item Finally, you need to update the Maven dependencies by right-clicking the
project name, and select \textbf{Maven} $\rightarrow$ \textbf{Update
Project\ldots}.

\end{enumerate}

\item[Q2] I found a bug in the archetype and I know how to fix it. How should I
proceed to patch the archetype to help many others who may suffer from this? 

\item[A2] The archetype project is also hosted on GitHub at
\url{https://github.com/ziy/hw1-archetype}, and you can send a pull request to
me regarding any issue.

\end{qa}
