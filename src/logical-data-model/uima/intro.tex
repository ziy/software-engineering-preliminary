\chapter{Implementing A Named Entity Recognizer with UIMA SDK}

In this task, you need to implement a named entity recognizer based on UIMA SDK.
We assume you have finished all the reading assignments up to now, including the
UIMA specification, and browsed the Apache UIMA project website. You will find
\emph{Apache UIMA Manuals and Guides}
(\url{http://uima.apache.org/documentation.html#manuals_and_guides}) will be
helpful for you to finish this task. The \emph{Tutorials and Users' Guides}
gives you a step-by-step reference to build essential components for a
collection processing engine.

\begin{enumerate}

\item After you install the UIMA Eclipse plug-in, you will need to create a
collection processing engine from an archetype.

\item You might want to follow the illustrative instructions from
\emph{Tutorials and Users' Guides} to compose descriptors and Java codes.

\item Finally, you are required to describe the details of your named entity
recognition algorithm, and your type system design as well as your
implementation of each component. We also encourage you to report some
preliminary results based on your own evaluations.

\end{enumerate}
